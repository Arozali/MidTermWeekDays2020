Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

1.  why do we need data structure?
    - A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be use efficiently.
2.  What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
    - Various operations that can be performed on data structure are create, insert delete, searching, sorting , traversing , merging, appending and updating
3.  List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    - Compiler design, operating system, database management system, statistical analysis package, numerical analysis, graphics, artificial intelligence, and simulations
4.  what is an Array?
    - Array is an object which contains elements of similar data type. Array is a dat structure that stores similar elements. Arrays can only store a fixed number of elements determined at the time of declaration.
5.  what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    - Array is a data structure that hold only a fixed number of element determined at declaration. Arraylist on the other hand is a class that implements the List interface which is part of the collection framework. Unlike array, ArrayList has a number of methods that can support it.
6.  what is LinkedList?
    - LinkedList was introduced in java 1.5; is a class that implements the List interface and Queue interface, and is a member of the collection framework. Linked list used doubly linked list to internally to store elements and can store duplicate elements. Linked list maintains insertion order. It is non-synchronized and data manipulation fast
7.  How is an Array different from LinkedList?
    - Array is not a member of the collection framework where as LinkedList is a class. arrays can only hold data of the same type LinkedList can hold element of various data type. in array you can access the data using index numbers. In LinkedList you need to traverse through the entire list to get to the element you want. So accessing elements in array is faster that LinkedList. In array elements are stored based on index numbers. In linkedList elements are stored randomly. Array requires less memory but has inefficient memory utilization. LinkedList requires more memory but has better memory utilization.
8.  what is queue?
    - Queue is an interface that implements the Collection interface. Queue manipulated element in FIFO order.
9.  what is stack?
    - Stack is the child class of vector class that implements the List interface. List manipulates data in LIFO order.
10. what is FIFO and LIFO?
    - FIFO - Fist In First Out. LIFO - Last In First Out.
11. what is the order of complexity?
    -
12. what is the best case to search an element from an array?
13. what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
14. what is tree in data structure?
15. what is graph in data structure?
16. what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
17. What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
18. How HashMap works in java?
19. What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
20. What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
21. What is difference between an array and a linked list?
22. What is DFS and BFS?
23. What is Recursion?
24. What are linear and non linear data Structures?
25. What is Big-(O)-notation?
26. Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
27. Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
