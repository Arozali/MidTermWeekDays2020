Please answer the below core-java Questions:

1.  What is programing language?
	- A programming language is a formal language that computer programmers use to create a program which is a set of instruction that achieves a single outcome.
2.  What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
	- JDK stand for Java Development kit which is composed of 
		+ javac compiler - to compiler to compile the java files to class file which contains the byte-code
		+ javap to view the preimplementation
		+ javadoc to convert the documentation to html file
		+ jdb to debug the java code
		+ JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which contains the JVM. JVM contains the class loader, Bytecode verifier, garbage collector, Security Manager, Execution Engine(JIT Compiler)
3.  What is IDE?
	- Integrated Development Environment is a software that enables the developers to write, compile and run the source code all from the same location.
4.  What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
5.  Explain the entire java life cycle.
	- Source code is written with the .java extention. The javac compiles the source code and produces the .class files which is loaded into JVM by the class loader. the bytecode verifier points to memory where the class is loaded. The garbage collector releases objects that are no longer in user. The exxecution engine converts the byte code to machine language which is then executed by the machine.
6.  what is class?
	- class is a bluepring that defines and object
7.  What is object?
	- Object is an instance of a class
8.  What is the entry point of an application?
	- In java the main method is the entry point to the application. 
9.  Why main is static?
	- The main method is static so that JVM can directly access the method without creating an instance of the class.
10. Which class is the superclass of all classes?
	- The Object class is the super class of all calsses
11. What is difference between path and classpath variables?
	- path refers to the path to all java tools. classpath refers to the all java classes which are used in the java application. 
12. What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
	- Intefaces is pure abstract class with abstract methods and final variables where as abstract classes can have both abstract methdos and concrete methods
13. Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
	- Interfaces and Abstract classes cannot be instabciated. You can only implemet interfaces and exted Abstract classes to use  their methods
14. what is Access Specifier?
	- Access Specifier specifies the accessability to a class and all its methods and variables. There are four access specifiers - public, protected, default and private.
15. What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
	- OOP stands for Object oriented programming. Abstraction - creates interfaces and abstract, encapsulation - data hiding using private variables and methods, inheritance - single like multi-level inheritance and polymorphism - method over loading and overriding
16. What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
	- In java a package is a collection of classes and interfaces. In order to access a class or interface java needs to import the packages. Java internally imports java.lang package by default
17. What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
    - API stand for Application Programming Interface is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. Google sheet API, Selenium API, JDBC API, Excel Reader API
18. Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
    - Java only supports single line multilevel inheritance in order to avoid complexity of coding
19. What is method overloading and when it happens?
    - Method or constructor overloading can occur when the same method or constructor is rewritten in the same class with different parameters
20. Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
    - Exceptions are errors that occur during runtime. Exceptions are handles by using try-catch block or by using throws
21. What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
    - method, variables, blocks and inner classes defined as static reside at the class level and can be called without creating an instance of a class. values assigned to static variables can be accessed by multiple instances of that class. static methods cannot be overloaded.
22. What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
    - Final is used to define class, variables and methods that cannot be changed. final variables must be initialized either immediately or in the constructor or in the static block. Final methods cannot be overridden. Final classes cannot be extended
23. What is final, finally and finalize?
    - Final is used to define constants, finally is a block if defined will be executed at the end of a try-catch block, and Finalize is use to clear objects that are not in use from jvm memory before garbage collector is called.
24. What is a constructor ?
    - The constructor is called using the new keyword in order to create an instance of a class. Constructors are similar to methods but lack return type keyword. Constructs can only have same name as the class where it is defined.
25. Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
    - Yes you can overload constructors and have multiple constructors in the same class and all of them can be used to create instances of the class.
26. If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
    - If you do not declare a constructor java will call the default constructor of the class to create the object of the class.
27. What is "this" keyword in java ?
    - this keyword is used to refer to the current class. so it can be used to call the global variables or methods. this() can also be call the current class constructor.
28. What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
    - super keyword refers to the parent class and can be used to call the parent class method and instance variables. super() can also to invoke the super class constructor.
29. What is JVM stand for ?
    - Java Virtual Machine. It is part of JRE where the java class files are loaded and executed.
30. Is JVM platform independent?
    - JVM is not platform independent! Several variations of JVM is available for various operating systems that enables running java class files.
31. What version of java are you using?
    - Currently using JDK 14. -> Safe to say still using JDK 8
32. What is JAR stand for ?
    - JAR Stands for Java ARchive. It's method of packing java program into a single archive that can be transported and run on other JVM.
33. What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
    - JDK stand for Java Development Kit which contains JRE that contains the JVM
34. What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
    - JRE is Java runtime environment that contains the JVM
35. What is compile time and run time?
    - Compile time is the time when the .java file validated and checked for syntax errors. Run time is the time when the .class file is executed and validated for logical errors.
36. What is heap?
    - Heap is par of JVM memory that hold objects.
37. How java manage it's memory?
    - java manages the JVM memory with the help of the garbage collector. JVM load the .class file using the class loader and loads all reference variables, methods and objects into JVM memory to be used. Once they are no longer needed they are cleared from memory with the help of the garbage collector.
38. What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
    -
39. What is Singleton class?
40. What is Serialization and Deserialization?
41. when to use transient variable in java?
42. Difference between while and do..while loop?
43. What is Enum?
44. What is Iterator?
45. Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
46. Why is String Immutable in Java?
47. What is constructor chaining in Java?
48. The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
49. What is JIT stands for?
50. Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
51. Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
52. What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
53. What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
54. what is multithreading in java?
55. What is the use of synchronization in Java?
56. What is Framework?
57. What are the testing Framework available in java?
58. Difference between jUnit and testNG?
59. What are the dependencies for this project?
60. what is dependency injection in java?
61. What is static binding and dynamic binding?
